git filter-branch -f --tree-filter "rm -rf N3Base/lib/N3Base.lib" HEAD

- get working with SDL2 and then reset the project

- can easily editor the UIF (and maybe some other) files by writing their
	contents to a .json file using duktape, modifying that file, and then
	converting that back to whatever custom format they use
- at least this would work nice for UIF files (better than digging through hex)

- need to get the cursor working
- need to remove all the _DEBUG (for now)
