===============================================================================
- the issue here is that item files in the data directory aren't accessable
	from the item table

- got a chest piece for the rogue to work but I have to rename a .n3cpart file
- get character creation working

- support all 1068 file formats
	- requires testing of weapons and armor and stuff
- need to check progess UI on statebar
- need to get the teleporter to work
	- a fully working tele would require a DB
	- need something that will work well for a DevServe
- setup dev server with no DB
- fixed so that it compiles with debug config
	- better to wait until I can start with blank new projects
- take a look at the new zone files 1298 added (ens, gev, etc.)
